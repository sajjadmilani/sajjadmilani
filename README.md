As soon as I became aware of technology, I found myself extremely fascinated by it. This led me to earn a bachelor's degree in information technology engineering while also working as a web developer.

🧠 I'm currently learning JavaScript based Technologies

## 🛠 Skills

The skills I possess include learning new skills and programming languages quickly, as well as problem solving, team play, and website optimization. So far I have acquired knowledge of ASP.NET MVC, C#, .Net Framework, MSSQL, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

I've started updating myself through learning React, Node.JS, MongoDB, Git/GitHub and Express.JS. In addition, I'm still interested in learning other programming languages, frameworks, or principles.
